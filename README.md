# CornFoot: IntelliJourney

## Summary
The first group project at Academia de Código, an intensive fullstack bootcamp, developed in one week by team **Bravo** after our 1st month coding. 

## CornFoot
Our project consits of a platform game, whose hero is CornFoot (inspired on one of our peers). The goal is to take CornFoot to Academia de Código, avoiding all the dangers and possible distractions on the path of our soon to be developer!

**Technology Stack**: Java 7, using the SimpleGX library.

**Bravo Team:** [Beatriz Pires](https://github.com/beatrizalmeidapires), [Gonçalo Feiras](https://github.com/goncaloff), [João Furnas](https://github.com/JoaoFurnas), and [Luís Ferreira](https://github.com/lguilhermef).
